For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce

argument that might be the root of the problem. But if

For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that

your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Or maybe a } was forgotten somewhere earlier, and things

I've run across a `}' that doesn't seem to match anything.
For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.

Runaway argument?
