\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{Garfinkel et al.?s article on small block forensics is motivated by four main reasons. They state at the start of the article, ?there is a growing need for automated techniques and tools that operate on bulk data, and specifically on bulk data at the block level.? What are these reasons?}{}% 3
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.4}{The ?small block forensics? approach proposed by Garfinkel et al. includes the use of sampling from a drive to find files already known to be of interest. Suppose you?ve recently acquired 160TiB \(that is, 160 * 240 bytes\) of data, and you are looking for any portion of 512GiB \(512 * 230 bytes\) of files that you know to be of interest. How many 4096 byte samples \(uniform, at random, without replacement\) would you expect to have to take from the drive such that the probability of failing to find even one of the files of interest is less than 0.01\045 \(that is, p < 0.0001\)? Make the simplifying assumption that all files are located at 4096 byte offsets.}{}% 4
